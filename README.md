# bypass-cors-policies

Bypass CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies of a remote server. This tool is particularly useful for development purposes when working with APIs that don't provide the necessary CORS headers for local development.

> **Warning**: Use responsibly! Only use this for legal and legitimate purposes. Bypassing CORS on servers without permission can be illegal and unethical.

## How It Works

When you set `SERVER_NAME` to a specific value, any route accessed on this tool will map directly to the same route on the specified server. For example:

If `SERVER_NAME` is set to `https://www.example.com`, accessing 
`https://localhost:3000/hello/world.json` in your browser or through 
a tool will fetch and return the content 
from `https://www.example.com/hello/world.json`. The file, along with its path, will be stored locally. Thus, upon subsequent requests, there will be no call to `https://www.example.com`.

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Miorey/bypass-cors-policies
    cd bypass-cors-policies
    ```

2. Modify the `.env` file and set the `SERVER_NAME` to the server from which you wish to bypass CORS:
    ```env
    SERVER_NAME="https://www.example.com"
    ```

3. Install the necessary Node version using nvm:
    ```bash
    nvm install
    nvm use
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

5. Start the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Docker Compose Setup

1. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file and set the `SERVER_NAME` environment variable:

    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      bypass-cors-policies:
        image: miorey/bypass-cors-policies
        environment:
          - SERVER_NAME=https://www.example.com
          - PRESERVE_STORAGE=true
        volumes:
          - ./storage:/usr/src/app/storage
        ports:
          - "3001:3000"
    ```
By default, the timout to the remote call is 2sec this value can be change through `TIMEOUT` env var.
You can decide to not save the file in the storage directory by removing the `PRESERVE_STORAGE` parameter.

2. Run the Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

## Data Storage

Files are stored in the `storage` directory. To clear stored files, simply remove the contents of the `storage` directory:
```bash
rm -rf storage/*
```
